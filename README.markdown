# FamFamFam Silk Icon Sprite

Now, the [most popular icon set in the world](http://www.famfamfam.com/lab/icons/silk/) gets HTTP optimized.

## Why?

Because of [this Facebook image](http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/zEZ1P/hash/4mxpf6vf.png) and because we shouldn't have to make the user load each and every icon. A single big download once is often faster than several small ones.

## How?

<pre>
ruby script/plugin install git://github.com/JackDanger/silk_icon_sprite.git
</pre>

## Should I fork this and improve it?

Yes, right now.

## Should I host the image on my CDN for the world to enjoy?

Yes, please do that so the world can use this wonderful icon set even more easily.
Let me know where you host it and I'd be happy to use your url as the official one.

### Copyright

All the hard work was done by [Mark James](http://www.famfamfam.com/lab/icons/silk/) when
he created the icons but [Jack Danger Canty](http://j√•ck.com) spritified it.
